## How to Run

The precondition for running this program is having java installed on the computer executing the code.

The code can then either be cloned from the Github repository or extracted from the zip file. 

To clone the Github repository, enter the follow command in the command line: git clone https://github.com/ChelseaFlores/WordStatistics.git

Otherwise, extract the code from the zip file and cd into the WordStatistics folder using cd in the command line.

Then, cd into the src code folder using the following command line: cd WordStatistics/Word-Statistics/src

Compile the code with the command line: javac Driver.java

Execute the program by typing java, the java filename, the word to replace, the replacement word, and then any text files you want the program to analyze with spaces between each filename. Sample text documents have be provided. Command line example: java Driver.java "text" "doc" text.txt



The program will then go through each argument (file), perform the required functionality, and print to stdout.
